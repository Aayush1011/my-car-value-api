### my-car-value-api

Simple API built using NestJs with PostgreSQL as database that allows users to signup/login. Users can then get an estimate for how much their vehicle is worth based on various criteria. Users can also report what they sold their vehicle for. Reported sales have to be approved by admin. This project is a Code Along while learning Stephen Grider's NestJs course from Udemy.
